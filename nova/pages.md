## Basic Pages

### Controlling Access

For basic pages, you can control who has access to the page by specifying a permission key to the page record. By indicating a permission key, Nova will also require that the visitor be logged in to the site in order to access the page. If the user is not logged in or does not have the appropriate permission, they'll be shown a page that they are not authorized to view the page.
